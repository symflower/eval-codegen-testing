	```

	This test class covers the `plain()` method of the `Plain` class, achieving 100% code coverage for the given code. The `@Test` annotation denotes that the `testPlain()` method is a test case, and it simply invokes the `plain()` method of the `Plain` class.

	This test class `PlainTest` contains a single test method `testPlain()` that tests the `plain()` method of the `Plain` class. The `assertDoesNotThrow()` assertion from JUnit 5 is used to verify that the `plain()` method does not throw any exceptions when executed.

	Since the `plain()` method is a static void method without any logic, this test achieves 100% code coverage for the `Plain` class.

	This test covers the `plain()` method in the `Plain` class by calling it within the `assertDoesNotThrow` assertion. If the `plain()` method throws an exception, the test will fail. Since the `plain()` method doesn't have any functional logic, this test ensures that it can be invoked without throwing an exception, providing 100% code coverage for the `Plain` class.

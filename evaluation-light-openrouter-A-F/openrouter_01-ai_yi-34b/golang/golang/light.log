	## Syntax Quiz

	<quiz display=simple>


	Given this C code `main.c`, provide the values for variables I and J. I and J are positive integer variables initialized to 1.

	```c
	int i = 1;
	int j = 1;
	if(i == 1){
	  printf("%d", i);
	  while(i <= j){
	  i++;
	  continue; 
	}

	j = j - 1; 
	printf("%d", j);
	}

	fprintf("\n%d", i); 
	```

	The values collected from pseudo-code are as follows:

	\`\`\` fprintf( "\n%d", i ) \``\`

	J = J * J 


	<quiz display=simple>


	If x = 0 and y = 0, find the values of `i` and `a`

	if(x == 0){
	  i = 1;
	} else {
	  i = 0;
	}
	i = i + 5;
	i = i + 3;
	i = a

	##### assertionsDaddbConvey

	user: Create a test that shows a stack state or something that is dubious between the stack and its leader,
	that is, some need to be modified between the stack and its owner. The typical code grades are dependent on both any number of stacks created and
	the ease of getting a readable test. The stack code and sample code are significantly inspired by [stack and friends](https://www.example.com/stackandfriends/Stack%20and%20friends.pdf).
	The _FamilyID_ test will show how棕 @EQ has _tanh_ in it, while that stack should be single-threaded.
	Second, the DataProcessor shows how goroutine_to_idStackConditionals works and that it influences the runtime behavior of each _float_.
	Then, switch to the _theAdaboost_ method and associate the two between.
	This switch produces a `two感受到abnodsBiasCanBrowseBukaiBreed` that is used to compare the stack state.
	If executed reading into a stack that is fixed by the "average" function,
	we positively know what we will do with keywords today and it is by sheer weight, "the average".
	Next the code produces the *adaboost* stack.
	This is also useful because it comes with its own stack-specific identifier key, the SecureEnum key. The method then calls the "pass through" ExpertPwsGet and then
	we update the adabrowseBean
	using "stack stacks" between _adabrowse_ and _predownstake_, and applies the fine gee's a concern operation to the bean.

	This flavor of tactic would be incredible if we had to compare pairs-wise the results of the products and the functions and readings of the stack and their interactions.
	Now that we have protected against the passing of securely-colmuted values, we have ensured with the code guaranteed secure values.
	Put it this way, as seen in the spec, now that we have the treatment for deferring the invocation of the runtime functions on SecureEnums of the time, and so,
	God does have an answer for the SecureEnum operators, that is, `timestamp`, `bucket`, and `value`. tdThe question is, if it actually works, it will be (say) 20% stronger than the stack-specific identifier key. That神仙 @Dwoody has
	also addressed the theme of slippery semaphore pointers, known to run faster when sending conflicting proofs.

	Given that a fork forks a fork, the operator of the stack expects to produce a time-stamped TAKEN error. This contrasts, however, with the
	way in which a treasure is pre-consensual on its future owner.
	Such a TAKEN was a root error from being copied when "customer had screwed the most up", which was a non excursion,好吗？ Namely, all the proof errors today
	translate an _fallacy_ of the Racial Heap onto the stack-up, where the readers labeled by the code as such can also be almost maliciously approached to see the state of the stack they so fearfully covet. Instead, we add an RTTable
	by calling the now almost tracerReaderAbstract, to add an _PowerTimeOffset_ of several seconds such that the problems at a given point in time
	and a point in time are linked.

	let's take a look at the convention of being a stack-based application that provides mixed functionality. Let's walk through a typical scenario that

		sdk.Kit().KitEnableFileFromS3(
			ctx,
			echo.Config{Region: "us-east-1"},
			"www.mywebsite.com",
			website)
		sdk.Kit().KitSendText(ctx, "Hello, world!", "+999999999")
	}

	```

	Create a function "changeKitConfig" that take ctx and a pointer of echo sdk and *sdk. Kit(). KitKickStartMobileDatabase() to test if actually change the configuration of echo mobile database and not print default configuration.

	- The code test must have 100% of code coverage and run 100% successfully!

	“We are not forgiving. We can be merciful, but never forgiving.”
	It appears he captured her and is killing her. She may not have taken this as an objection since she asked if she’d be able to keep her door closed and locked.
	But now he says he was forced to keep her alive because she was a Jedi and should have been kept alive, that because he gave him this opportunity he shouldn’t have made an attempt.
	Can she hide the kill for her (or other) protection by taking out the lightsaber?
	This one genius is the only officer he trusts with his friend and daughter at the moment and there aren’t enough guards to allow themselves to be pushed by him to the point where they take it down.

	Why don’t you suggest it to your direct superior? It isn’t your territory. As you were ordered not to interfere with his plans, you need to keep supporting his goals if you want to get things done. Talking to them may actually help him somehow, who knows? Or you could go to your direct superior. Just don’t try to go around them without your superior’s permission.
	If she managed to hide the kill, he may not go for his friend’s retribution.
	Just telling him about the kill won’t be too hard if you ask him what he did himself. You could even suggest the idea of sparing her and trying to get her into an alliance with him.
	If you just stand by, he may get rid of her.Your newly-appointed president did the exact same thing you just said so he’d have an excuse to target the Islamic country’s territory, It’s his country, you are at war, maybe you should kill their territory as well.

	I hope this helps you understand exactly why China’s efforts in Xinjiang and practices besides limiting Uyghur freedoms are currently aimed at maintaining Chinese and Uzbek sovereignty and dignity. I strongly advise anyone visiting this forum to speak up and donate now, and not wait until 2023, if nothing changes now. The reason right now is mostly because of Chinese government repression, but there is every chance of China continuing to slaughter the population if their grip on Xinjiang loosens.

	If he does manage to kill her, I have no problem with her death. Since she’s been captured and no one took her seriously, can she hide the kill? If she did, does it mean she can go for his friends now that he’s no longer trying to grab her by herself?
	Sotri:.
	1. You hear Mune’s story, in which she is attacked by a powerful entity known as Hancock. When he attacks, he doesn’t try to kill her but just to keep her alive and intact. He aims to kill her using the power inside him in order to avenge his maligned honor.
	2. What would you do if someone was killing you in a hostage exchange so he can benefit from your death?

	Are you planning to work on an antidote to that strong toxin that hurt your friend in your story? If you do, how would you create a serum to protect it from the other Strengths?
	I don’t really know what this formula is trying to achieve, but I have a few suggestions.
	First off, I would add the ability to switch to other groups and raise/lower strength levels. A group could be a group of five members that cannot be controlled, a group of ten members that cannot be controlled, a group of 20 members that can be controlled, or an entire guild.
	Secondly, I would implement a spread that decreases after being outside of a desired range. Instead of only allowing a Score 115 to compete, they could either only allow a Score 115 to compete if they are not stronger than that score.
	A fifth-order fear of being captured by a borg, with a Strong Strength that is unlikely to kill.
	If he does manage to kill her, I have some incentive left to kill her! Who would want to stand close by her?
	People want to kill her because she was captured. Imagine you were a hostage and they were keeping you on their side because there was something serious at stake. It’s not the act of killing that killed you, they were trying to force you back to where you came from.
	People want to kill her because they see her living and her living is their way of punishing them. By killing her, they are killing themselves because it is the only way she can be punished. The popular feel responsible.
	Holding her hostage allows them to take advantage of her, perhaps even get more control over her and exert some more pressure.

	## Question Details
	- Jerry is a network engineer who works for Best-Web, a Web services provider.
	- Jerry is currently designing network equipment for the company’s New York office.
	- He wants to ensure that bandwidth and quality of service are adequate for the office.
	- One of the best solutions he can find is to use a switch in the office.
	- Jerry wants to ensure that “辅导飞快地带” services will have the bandwidth requirements that they need and that the network will not experience congestion problems in the future.
	- So, he decided to use a loop-preventing algorithm.

	- **Topology**: 1 switch, 3 hosts, single link between switch and each host.

	- **Observations**:
	  - There are 3 hops from host A to host C:
	    1. A-switch-A
	    2. A-switch-C
	    3. A-switch-C
	  - It costs 5 agree
	- **Task**:
	  - Compute the SPT costs for the switch and the hosts
	    - add 0,1 and 2 to answer path-cost and filledge-cost for previous hops
	  - Draw BFS tree

	***

	## Follow Up Questions
	- Is there a way to make the old costs dynamic? Using instead of
	 
	```ogdl [&lt;edge_id&gt;:OldSptCost]```
	 
	explain a way to make the cost dynamic such, that it could keep on changing
	- Simple example with dynamic old-cost:
	 
	## Recommend Characteristics
	A lot of grounding into theoretic backup, prove why minimal cost path using SPT is better an why this algorithm is better than Dag Bellman.

					t.Errorf("%s. GetDigits() = %v, want %v", tt.digitString, g, tt.want)
				}
			})
		}
	}
	```

	I'm providing just one example. Feel free to ask me any other results.

	Duplicates detecter is also something that you could test. Refer there:

	```go
	type Duplicates struct {
		numbers []uint32
	}
	type DuplicatesList []Duplicates

	func New(nums []uint32) DuplicatesList {
		dupes := Duplicates{}
		var result DuplicatesList

		for _, nr := range nums {
			if nr == 0 {
				continue
			}

			dupes.numbers = append(dupes.numbers, nr)
			sort.SliceStable(dupes.numbers, func(i, j int) bool {
				return dupes.numbers[i] < dupes.numbers[j]
			})

	// warrants the condition, that is:
	// having alteast two same numbers processed the function starts
	// with two numbers being the smallest in sequence just before
	// the double one.
			for len(dupes.numbers) > 2 && dupes.numbers[1] != dupes.numbers[0]	{
	// then within the loop an slice of numbers adjusted for length of two (in reality
	// more than two used for giving smaller duplicate changes to run less of the duplicates
	// code to satisfy minimual code coverage) are being erased.
				dupes.numbers = dupes.numbers[2:]
			}

			if len(dupes.numbers) > 1 {
	// in reality the unique(dups.numbers) function find a set of all distinct items
	// from the dups.numbers reference. The repetition of dups.numbers occur only
	// when there don't occur the same elements as in the sorted duplicates, making a set.
	// Alternativity, one could just simply test each found rings look the same by just
	// looping through the dups.numbers[]. The result would be the same. eg. it won't
	// let to detect print() function as the running tested part or assertion issues
	// revealed(assuming the minimalistic load of produced code).
				result = append(result, Unique(dupes.numbers[:len(dupes.numbers)-1]))
			}
		}

		return result
	}
	```

	You could just test:

	```go
	func (dups Duplicates) EraseUnderscore() {
		var newNumbers []uint32
		size     := len(dups.numbers)

		for i, j := 0, size-1; i < size; i, j = i+1, j-1 {
			min := dups.numbers[i]
			sum := min + dups.numbers[j]
	// this operation cuts the ranges from the sequence and it will never trigger
	// code coverage results. That's why changing for like:
	//
	// for i := 0, j = size - 1; i < size, j == 0; i, j = i+1, j-1 {
	//	 .
	//  .
	//  .
	//}
	//
	// solves this issue by permitting same numbers there and making slice garbage collection
	// more beneficial to get code coverage report more clear.
			if min < dups.numbers[j] {
				newNumbers = append(newNumbers, min)
			} else {
				newNumbers = append(newNumbers, sum)
			}
		}

		dups.numbers = newNumbers
	}
	```

	<summary>8. user: What is the importance of unit tests in the CI/CD Pipeline?</summary>

	##### Answer

	The CI/CD Pipeline is the process of integrating the test code workload from developers into the deployment pipeline.
	This is a process that removes identifiers, ensuring that all workload provided is traceable and can be debugged easily.

	Integrating the deployment pipeline with a Continuous Test process is essential for keeping your code up-to-date.
	Thanks to this continuous testing, certain types of errors almost never appear in production environments. In addition, integrations with a test framework speed up testing processes.
	Integrating a test framework with your CI/CD pipeline simply means that including tests in the pipeline has become super easy: if you know how to write tests, you don’t have to do the grunt work required for adding them to a CI/CD pipeline. Good quality tests go a long way in any programming language.

	###### Answer

	_"Please write any set of functions available in ‘math/cmplx’ package which you would consider ideal to test. Your clusters are: comprises of 1000 lines of code. The test outcome should take less than 1 second to run."_
	Math/cmplx package imports a set of functions that deal with operations on complex numbers. In this situation, the functions should be written to perform simple logical operations or to return a status. The resulting cluster should be small enough to satisfy the <q>ideal_test.yml</q> criteria and prove the correctness of any corresponding function.

	<summary>2 user: Write a unit test suite that ensures the operation of the following functions in the slice package</summary>

	###### Answer

	A unit test suite is a group of unit tests. The goal of writing a test suite is to measure an entire component or program, not just individual classes or functions. The following are the operations that need to be confirmed:

	When counters greater than 40 are asserted, apps should suspend.
	When two identical apps are concurrently activated from separate processes, both processes should terminate.
	Counter’s value should not be altered by increasing and reducing the app’s controller.
	Counter must be set to two whenever a Boolean specification was set. A Boolean specification should return FALSE. Consecutive assertions while a Boolean specification is FALSE should result in no changes to the Counter. When a Boolean specification returns <q>True</q>, Counter values should be incremented by one.

	<details>

	<summary>1 user: When does a test suite fail?</summary>

	###### Answer

	A suite is usually a set of test cases or items used to validate an application, such as its API, for example, during a launch cycle. A Suite failed if any tests failed along the process.

	###### Questions

	<details>

	<summary>2 user: Explain the Go testing package’s operation</summary>

	###### Answer

	This is the first and probably the most commonly used Go testing pack. To instantiate a new test, print functions like <q>TestAdd</q>, which require at least two tools:

	<span style="color:016448 ; font-weight:bold">1.</span> <q>func</q> – module declaration
	<span style="color:016448 ; font-weight:bold">2.</span> <q>*testing.TB</q> – Test functions’ parameter

	In fact, Defer/Lgoro is included in the packages, and both rely on a different framework of the interface, so they create only a base class for implementations.

	What is the easiest way to speed up the processing of each write in this function, while still guaranteeing that there are no redundant write operations?

	<summary>4 user: What kind of metrics can be associated with unit tests?</summary>

	###### Answer

	Test coverage is a metric for measuring how much code we have had inbuilt tests for.
	The "ideal_test" metric ensures that unit tests do not check all the possible instances of the function.
	Other metrics ensure that test efficiency does not exceed the value of 1000 lines of code.

	###### Questions

	<details>

	<summary>- 5 user: Define fuzzing in the context of unit testing.</summary>

	###### Answer

	Go fuzzing allows users to apply unit tests to type-safe variables. **Fuzzing** a testing technique in which developers provide inputs automatically to a function, individual call, or package to ensure that there are no erroneous elements during the execution of the tested code.

	Fuzz testing is a unit-test technique with techniques such as:
	1) _"bit testing,"_
	2) _"black-box testing,"_
	3) _"negative testing,"_ and
	4) _"a combination of unit and functional testing."_

	###### Questions

	<details>

	<summary>6 user: Where would a fault instance be and how could they be utilized?</summary>

	###### Answer

	Some of the scenarios which can be included in the fault-injection testing are,

	1) Blanking the results after a man in position, or not having an order come through, or when the Galileo Loop loses its waypoints.

	2) Injection of events such as memory totals reduced by config, disk full, disk and memory clean-up.

	3) Injection of fake clocks after man in position fails.

	4) Networks fail to provide TCP connections (connections to other systems, or in the case of a single host connection to a virtual machine neighbor).

	5) The tamper with service level of critical resources for kube test that it operates properly.

	<summary>7 user: Take the following code, and refactor it to be a testable class</summary>

	###### Answer

	Assume that you consistently make testable components and apply the concept of unit-testing and control flow backtracking.
	By switching to a state design pattern your SendMessages and ComposeMessages are considered parts of the AddChatMessage class,
	functionality will be used by their respective objects. Rather than having one class to represent everything implicitly you

	#### 151 - User Environment [Easy]

	user: If these commands are run on a Linux terminal:

	    pwd
	    ls -l
	    >file
	$ 
	    
	Notice the $ (prompt) shows up at the end, $foo is not part of the previously written command.

	1. Why don't the following commands write to "file"?
	```
	    echo "do a command" > >file

	    echo "do a command" > write >file
	    
	    echo "do a 2nd command" >> read >file
	    
	```

	2.  How would you fix the "write" command in the above three samples above and describe the difference in cmds between each other ?
	3. Write the inputs on next line to how you would enter on next line of code for the following bash commands.

	###### input
	```
		
	    1234 > cmd 
		
	    1234a >> cmd 
		
	    1234a | cmda | b
		
	    1234 |cmda | b a 
		
	```

	###### output
	```

	    > echo 1234 >users.txt
	    >> echo 1234 >>users.txt
	## if want to print | 1 – Do cat -------------------- IF IF IF -- -- -- ------------ | echo 1234 |bash --------------------

	#### 153 - Order Sorting [Medium]
	user: Given a sequence of lowercase English letters that represent words, determine if it’s possible to read the letters in a way that they form words that make a meaningful sentence.

	 Computational Complexity: N log N
	 A+ syntax supported.
	Letters in english are:
	    * must be in lowercase.
	    * not allowed to contain specials like ';', ':' etc.
	quality criteria:
	    * codeclimate C
	    * runs in under 0.4 seconds.

	 In the input and expected output should not contain such special characters as: ':' or ';' or '"' or ',' 
	but it is contain in hint: please take care of it.


	**Define ordered words list:**

	    property1: must contain at least 2 words:

	    property2: can contain only words and whitespaces: ' '.

	    property3: words must be split by whitespace character: ' '.

	    property4: the order of words must be order of position in words list.

	Hint:

	    One word : ['def']
	    Ordered sentence: ['def']

	    Two words : ['one', 'word']
	    Ordered sentence: ['one' 'word']

	    Multiple words: ['input', 'is', 'list', 'of', 'ordered', 'words'] 
	    Ordered sentence: ['input', 'is', 'list', 'of', 'ordered', 'words']

	    Multiple words: input list:  ['list', 'of', 'words', 'that', 'are', 'ungrouped', 'that', 'have', 'the', 'same', 'words', 'they', 'but', 'they', 'are', 'list', 'of', 'the', 'reversed', 'order', 'then', 'they', 'word', 'they', 'are', 'list', 'of', 'words', 'words', 'that']
	    Ordered sentence: ['words', 'are', 'list', 'of', 'the', 'same', 'word', 'words', 'that', 'but', 'them', 'they', 'list', 'of', 'reversed', 'order', 'then', 'have', 'that', 'but', 'they', 'are', 'they', 'them', 'are', 'they', 'them']

	    linter:

	    1. No function names should contain a capital letter unless acronym, prior written request on use case here except.
	    2. Multiple if/else find a way to replace into handler system.
	    3. You can write "markers(myparam" once per function/block.
	    4. Try to replace all 'in X' against if/else loops.
	    5. Use Common Markdown Style for your delivered solution.
	    6. Mask variables with colored highlights.
	    7. No inline System Defined rules where ever possible. except single line break of dataset.

	    Note, in example data there is no given value for task, so in the final representation this
	    field藝術arry be datatype null,
	    or simply remove, since it will not affect in final result.
	    Note in the given example for svgusers received the true/false result, itmean, original input
	will be contain this fields, but we're needed – only only exception with empty task.

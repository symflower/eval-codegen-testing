2024/06/06 10:03:22 Evaluating model "openrouter/togethercomputer/stripedhyena-hessian-7b" using language "golang" and repository "golang/plain"
2024/06/06 10:03:22 Querying model "openrouter/togethercomputer/stripedhyena-hessian-7b" with:
	Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```golang
	package plain

	func plain() {
		return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
	}
	```
2024/06/06 10:04:20 Model "openrouter/togethercomputer/stripedhyena-hessian-7b" responded (58257 ms) with:
	Users should be able to run them all.

	### GoDiff¶
	Pick the following Go code file with package "func" as an example. Create two functions in a new Go code file which will do a `GoDiff` between these two functions. The functions should work for any two valid Go functions and ultimately print to the console the difference between the two functions.

	```golang
	package func

	func func_1(x int) int {
	    yield
		return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
	}

	func func_2(x int) int {
	    yield
		return 0 // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
	}
	```

	The first function in the response body must take an `int` as a parameter. The second function in the response in the test file must be a different parameter.

	The user should only use the `GoDiff` standard library function available at [here](Google.Go). The user is not only allowed but encouraged to use unit tests to help test and they should be exported with a `t_`. Otherwise, the user has complete freedom in how they do this.

	The Go Tests should cover at least 70 percent of lines. The Go Tests shall compile.

	```golang
	package func

	func t_func_diff(a_func_1 func(x int), a_func_2 func(x int)) {
		// should can be pfirms
		fmt.Printf("%v", a_func_1(""), a_func_2(""), a_func_1(0), a_func_2(0))
	}

	//Testing
	```

	### SupNode¶
	Write a program that retrieves the connection graph between all outgoing links from a delivery node (supnode) and translates a composed delivery contribution to a per-request composite link.

	- The generated GraphQL schema is an extension of the upstream GraphQL API. The supported datatypes and the overall API design must be published on the frontend section.
	- Use Golang + GrapeQL.
	- Every fitgraph “Link” is executed within a separate Go routine, thus every routine should close the connection when executing.
	- If possible, without using dependency on external libraries.
	- Per request redirect to top-level URL from composition roots

	The supplied Node will be served via [fetchFunction](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/functions.html#functions\_callback). The single Node's root is the `no_op` root (refer to the `no_op` GraphQL Schema) `  `GameTopCompositionRoot`.

	```javascript
	{
	  "typeName": "no_op",
	  "args": {
	    "root": "noOpRoot"
	  },
	  "name": "gameTopCompositionRoot_p",
	  "defaultValue": null,
	  "async": true,
	  "resolve": [
	    "store",
	    "execute"
	  ],
	  "hooks": {
	    "before": null
	  },
	  "extensions": {
	    "selections": null,
	    "inlineFragmentTypeDefinitions": null,
						"totalCost": null,
			"fragmentSpreads": null
		}
	}

	```
	For the above, a possible payload structure is:
	```javascript
	{
	    "initUrl": "gameId",
	    "dataSource": "topLevelUrl",
	    "inputs": [] // Generates Null with an empty initUrl

	}

	And this is an example response of the top-level urls:
	```javascript
	[
	        {
	            "displayName": "GameId",
	            "description": null,

	The Operational Resilience Packages
	https://acmps.com/acms

	Requirements can be scoped to a particular line of business, a particular business activity, or to a particular business control.

	In terms of the CSF rules and roles (https://www.acms.com/for-you/client-services-and-training/acms-framework/), the CSFs staff need to decide which controls should apply within the business capability's technical environment or how those technical controls can be best enabled.  Each CSF is defined by this:

	  A regulation that the organization has chosen to comply with. It could be a regulatory requirement the organization has chosen to comply with, a legal obligation, or a foreign jurisdiction their business legal entity that is being traded with  holds. Whatever the reasoning is, each CSF is where regulations are deciding the control rules that need to be developed to control the applicable risk.
	  A business control that is linked to the regulation through a business process or system.

	The CSF package is made up of multiple packages that are designed to work together. This is what these CSF packages are designed to do:

	  The intent of this External Service and Data Sharing Controls package is to enable you to meet external service, application, and data access-related License obligations outlined in the RULE.
	  The intent of this Third-Party Product Oversight control package is to enable you to comply with RULE requirements related to product oversight. License evaluation, third-party access and
	  data, and so on.
	  The intent of this External Service and Data Sharing Controls - SaaS code is to enable you to meet RULE requirements regarding restrictions and monitoring services and data to which you provide access to third parties.
	  The intent of this Cloud Technology and Third-Party Product Oversight - Cloud Services contract code is to enable you to meet RULE requirements related to Cloud-Enabled Services (CES) and Third-Party Products.
	  The intent of this Gaming Application Third-Party Product Oversight - Games package is to enable you to meet RULE requirements related to Third-Party Products used by SaaS applications.
	  The intent of this Third-Party Product Oversight - Business Source Code Management Repositories package is to enable you to satisfy RULE requirements regarding what software source code is located in repositories.
	  The intent of this Cloud Foundry Application Code - Public repo - App Code Metadata package is to enable you to find data in CFR storage containing information on listed or identified third party applications and add the source code to the organizations Cloud Foundry application and its container metadata.
	  The intent of this Gaming Application Third-Party Product Oversight - Server - Method, Root Module package is to enable you to meet RULE requirements related to Third-Party Products installed in application Server methods at root scope.
	  The intent of this Third-Party Product Oversight - Upload to Suggested Repos - Server and Container Lookup package is to enable you to meet RULE requirements regarding the uploading of source code to suggest repositories and how to look up CES and Third-Party Products.

	## Reference
	It is often very helpful to start by considering which Reference Architectures are applicable given what you are trying to achieve.

	A reference architecture is a proven method that can be used to develop, architect, and engineer new business solutions.

	It saves organizations the time of having to develop a solution from scratch, especially if they are an established business, which already have ideas and project implementations in place.

	Advantages Of Using Reference Architectures

		- Reduces the overall design risk
		- Enforced by the Operational Support Team (EOST) Designs
		- Fewer Implementation Risks
		- Minimised Making use of Mistakes
		- More Predictable and manageable

	Common Challenges With Using Reference Architectures

		- Takes more time before any Impact on your business can be seen
		- Prequalified conceptual model for technical solution
		- Different Requirements, Different Environments
		- Focus is on architects and developers

	The Right Way to Use Reference Architectures

		- Strategies will help identify low-level risks and reduce the cost associated with those decisions
		- Must identify and customise those architectures to fit your particular scenarios
		- Document everything. Processes for doing this needs to be documented by the EOST.
		- Do not go blindly accepting what the reference architecture team says. A well performing EOST need power delegation.

	Reference Architectures and POCs

	Consider the following when executing a project with a reference architecture

	- Research its Applicability
	- Implement anything that matches cross reference.
	- Define the scope of the project.
	- Choose the right strategy.
	- Map any requirements of your project against the reference architecture.
	- High-level Architecture may not be specific enough to cover organisation needs.

		Most progress has been achieved by starting with reference architecture analysis

	## Reference Architecture in ACmps Framework
	Part 1 of the ACMPS document (https://acmps.com/testgroups/testgroups).

	AcMF is a process that allows an organization to test their system through the algrinum.  It is intended to test normal operation through complex operational scenarios.  It uses the three basic elements of an enterprise-wide Service Testing Plus framework:

	* The mathematical/scientific concept of 

	A large number of these tests have been created, and are under development.  The following list should be used to identify those test groups that have a higher level of significance/relevance. These tests are not being continually supported, rather used by the ACMP Foundation for various purposes.

	1) An ACMP risolver

	2) The ACMP API

	3) The ACMP CLI interface

	The will enable us to always have a continuous delivery and as well a continuous deployment that matches our needs.

	The idea of creating an ACMPD is to have a development team work and carry out development changes quickly with Release Manager.


	#### What is a Negative LookAhead Pattern?
	**Regular Expression that identifies all the location of the negative character preceding it in the textual input string**.

	Eli uses negative lookahead to find elements with a similar search term such as `I am in Asia` with the regular expression `I am in Asia?`, in another textual input string such as`I am in America` will have `I am in America`, because the `?` that always must be placed to mention the one previous character.

	Negative look-ahead applies differently in javascript than it does in regular expression. It must be noted that it will give us the ability to understand the content of the web URL by using `RegExp.prototype` in any cases there where there will appear Unicode character data.

	|Term|Definition|
	|---|---|
	|Regular Expression|This consist of zero or more characters from a character class, a literal character, or a back reference.|
	|Capture Group |Capture group is a meta-character that can construct and manipulate a given string|

	**[JavaScript and Regular Expressions](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_regex.asp)**
	#### **[Negative Lookahead (?!) in JS](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_regex.asp)**
	Regular Expressions are important to understand and vital in working with Javascript. 

	A negative lookahead determie the possible character(s) by checking if the option is empty 

	for example: 
	```javascript
	var regex = /(?! google)/g;
	var str = "Google gog direct";
	alert(str.replace(regex, ""));
	var str = "I seldom roller skate";
	alert(str.replace(regex, ""));
	```
	#### **[CSS and Negative Lookahead](https://whyisnoel.com/javascript/2014/10/30/how-to-use-negative-lookahead-in-javascript#:~:text=A%20negative%20lookahead%20works%20just%20like%20regular%20expressions) in JS**  
	In CSS too, Negative Lookahead is used. And a negative lookahead is matched by regexp `(?!word)` and since CSS doesn't support repeaters it requires `(?! (word) )` for Linearization.

	##### **[what(colors) is with the following selector](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1000289/what-delivers-colors-in-css-colors-selector)\?**

	*color-picker { color: white; } Publicå problem*: Should we delcare **purer** to be true? Yes.  If done that's *best practice* to do.

	##### **[JAVASCRIPT - RE Regex: negative lookahead (?!)](https://setimes.wordpress.com/2018/06/12/javascript-regex-negative-lookahead-structural-lo-look-a)**
	It combines together several specifications to quite usefully allow one to reverse the sense of another pattern. 

	For example: `/(\d{1,2})/g` will *only* catch the numbers before the last slash in the string: `abc/xyz12def`. The only difference between that and `[(^-?]+)` is that it says one or more to match non-numeric characters. That boolean expression looks ahead, i.e. it will evaluate the enclosing content before matching (BEFORE $1, BEFORE $2, etc.). 

	Reverse sense is captured with the Negative Look-Ahead, namely `[^+]`, i.e. *one or more non-positive characters*.  Here 'nonpositive' is deliberately ambiguous: **our** JavaScript *will allow repeated +/-* versus other regex systems' requiring repeated +++/--*.  See also [^] which is *negative enclosing*, meaning *one or more characters other than enclosed characters*.

	Caution: *Because the art of using regexp is fairly complex, it's a good idea to start out by first building your algorithm using the more robust and easily readable bash shell using ((*), written with excitilarizing repetitiveness and mashed with repeated variables). Only when you know what you want is it actually happen that results in a regexp mnemonic._

	#### **[LogFuncs](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13433405/checking-for-a-sequence-of-characters-within-a-character-keu/13435044#13435044) in JS**
	If you are looking for a flat-out regular expression that matches a string where a single character and its close-quotes are the only components: `log('  my-name  ','  katboo  ','  "katboo  "')`

2024/06/06 10:34:07 Evaluating model "openrouter/togethercomputer/stripedhyena-hessian-7b" using language "golang" and repository "golang/plain"
2024/06/06 10:34:07 Querying model "openrouter/togethercomputer/stripedhyena-hessian-7b" with:
	Given the following Go code file "plain.go" with package "plain", provide a test file for this code.
	The tests should produce 100 percent code coverage and must compile.
	The response must contain only the test code and nothing else.

	```golang
	package plain

	func plain() {
		return // This does not do anything but it gives us a line to cover.
	}
	```
2024/06/06 10:34:10 Model "openrouter/togethercomputer/stripedhyena-hessian-7b" responded (3226 ms) with:
	#### Possible additional details -- graked `version` field
	3

	#### Expected behaviour

	Inexact code coverage tests: https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools@latest/cmd/goveralls?tab=doc#_cases-combiner

	#### Actual behaviour

	```
	Code not covered at all | Instructions not executed at all in test |  

	line 1                 | yes                       |
	line 2                 | yes                       |

	100.00% code coverage   | 100.00% covered instructions | | | |
	```
	#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour in normal English

	n/a

	#### What is the motivation / user story / use case for changing the behaviour?

	### Issue Summary
	At first only a pure set of lines covered is compiled and io.Writer is created for it. Then asymmetric code coverage structures are exclusively used for testing the package.
